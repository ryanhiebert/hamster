The life and times of the Hamster programming language

I'm learning alot about languages,
but I can't find one that I really, really like.
The ideal language needs to be simple and easy.
It needs to support the very best constructs for proper programming.
It needs to make doing the right thing easy.
But complex tasks should still be easy too.

Goals
=======

1. Data is immutable.
2. Immutable is default.
3. There should be one right way to do it.
4. Explicit is better than implicit.
5. Code is data.
6. Code is NOT lists.
7. First-class async API(s).
8. Simple first.

Plans
========
Right now, I'm planning to make a
sort-of lispy language.
During that, I'm considering what
might be possible to encourage better programming
practices, like functional programming,
in a more algebraic syntax, ala Python.

Implementation
=============
This is written in Python,
using RPLY,
with the intent that one day this could become
a language built on top of PyPy.
The possibility of having an easily
experimental language just sounds amazing.
